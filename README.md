# Contacts App
## Overview
This Contacts App is a mobile application developed as part of a 48-hour coding challenge. The purpose of the application is to mimic an iOS contacts app, providing features such as searching for contacts, viewing contact details, and implementing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing contacts.

The project utilizes the contacts_service package to populate and manage the contacts. In the 48 hour period I was able to code a search functionality to filter contacts based on user input and a details page to display contact information in a structured format. Lastly I also implementet CRUD operations so the user can add new contacts or edit the existing ones.

Due to time constraints, the user interface design only closely resembles the original iOS contacts app, with limited customization.

## Features
1. **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for contacts by name or number.
2. **Details Page**: Displays detailed information about a selected contact, including name, phone number, email, etc.
3. **CRUD Operations**:
- **Create**: Enables users to add new contacts to the device's contact list.
- **Read**: Retrieves and displays contacts from the device.
- **Update**: Allows users to modify existing contact information.
- **Delete**: Permits users to remove contacts from the device's contact list.
